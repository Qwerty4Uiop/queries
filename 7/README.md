# Description
The script determines the sum of the digits in an arbitrary character string. If the result is greater than 10, then the process continues - to find the sum of the digits again, and so on - until there is one number left.
# Example
| Source string | Result |
|---|---|
| t29h8n3m7l88g799999999999927 | 7 |

Explanation: the sum of all the digits in the source line is 169; 1 + 6 + 9 = 16; 1 + 6 = 7.
